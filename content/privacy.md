All the following points should be read as “to the best of my knowledge”. I am not a website expert, so I can’t vouch for how this website is actually implemented. I can only tell you about my intentions.

## Collection of your personal information

Nothing on this website requires you to identify yourself.

The website does not use cookies. Note: Most web browsers allow you to control the handling of cookies.

I have set the [Hugo Privacy options](https://gohugo.io/about/hugo-and-gdpr/#disable-all-services) so that all third-party services, including Google Analytics, should be disabled on this website.

## Sharing of your personal information

As I do not collect your personal information, there is nothing I can share.
