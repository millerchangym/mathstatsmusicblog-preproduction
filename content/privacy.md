All the following points should be read as “to the best of my knowledge”. I am not a website expert, so I can’t vouch for how this website is actually implemented. I can only tell you about my intentions.

## Collection of your personal information

Nothing on this website requires you to identify yourself. The only personal information collected while you visit this site is non-identifying information, such as browser type and operating system. This information is collected by Google Analytics for measuring visitor traffic to this site.

I do not collect this information and have no access to it other than as aggregated reports. [Here](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245) is the Google Analytics privacy page.

This information is collected via cookies. Most web browsers allow you to control handling of cookies. To the best of my knowledge, you can disable all cookies for this website without in any way reducing the functionality for you.

I have set the [Hugo configuration options](https://gohugo.io/about/hugo-and-gdpr/#disable-all-services) to "Disable All Services" so that your IP address is anonymised within Google Analytics and the "Do Not Track" request is respected.

## Sharing of your personal information

I don’t collect your personal information, so there is nothing I can share.

Google Analytics does collect some information about you. See the Google Analytics privacy page.

## Use of your personal information

For each visitor to reach the site, Google Analytics collects the following non-personally identifiable information, including but not limited to browser type, version and language, operating system, pages viewed while browsing the site, page access times and referring website address. This information is presented to me as aggregated reports for the purpose of gauging visitor traffic and trends.
