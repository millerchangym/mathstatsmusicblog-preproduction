*Views and opinions expressed are solely my own.*

I am a Data Analyst with the [University of Minnesota - Twin Cities](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/) [Health Sciences Technology Data and Analytics Team](https://it.umn.edu/experts-communities/health-sciences-technology-data-analytics) and the [Medical Education Outcomes Center](https://outcomes.umn.edu/). 

From Fall 2019 through Spring 2021, I was an adjunct instructor at [Normandale Community College](https://www.normandale.edu/), teaching DSCI 2000 (Foundations of Data Science). My first- and second-semester data-science students competed and placed in contests against four-year universities ([Fall 2019](https://www.normandale.edu/minnemudac), [Spring 2020](https://www.normandale.edu/dataderby), [Spring 2021](https://www.normandale.edu/community/newsroom/news-articles/normandale-students-finished-second-in-advanced-division-at-annual-mn-state-it-coe-data-derby)).

I hold a M.S. Statistics from [Iowa State University](https://www.iastate.edu/) and a B.S. Mathematics (Statistics emphasis) from the [University of Wisconsin -- Eau Claire](https://www.uwec.edu/). I have worked in life insurance, electronic health records, and marketing, with the bulk of my professional experience in education (actuarial, K-12, and higher education). My [masters creative component](https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/creativecomponents/534/) was on optimal block sizes for block bootstrapping of long-memory time series. I have also taken PhD-level coursework in [measure-theoretic probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory#Measure-theoretic_probability_theory).

My degree at the University of Wisconsin -- Eau Claire also included a music minor. My primary interests in music are transcription, analysis of post-tonal music of the late 19th century (e.g., Ravel, Prokofiev, Stravinsky), and the intersection of mathematics and music. I am also a hobby piano player: I own a Kawai CA67.
