I am a Senior Data Scientist - Global Knowledge Solutions at [General Mills, Inc.](https://www.generalmills.com/)

Prior to my current role, most of my experience was in education in the public sector, including statistics for medical-education research, research and planning at the community-college level, and K-12 educational accountability. I have also held private-sector roles in digital marketing, electronic health records, life insurance, and actuarial education.

I taught data science as an adjunct instructor at the community-college level for two years. My first- and second-semester data-science students competed and placed in contests against four-year universities ([Fall 2019](https://www.normandale.edu/minnemudac), [Spring 2020](https://www.normandale.edu/dataderby), [Spring 2021](https://www.normandale.edu/community/newsroom/news-articles/normandale-students-finished-second-in-advanced-division-at-annual-mn-state-it-coe-data-derby)).

I hold a M.S. Statistics from [Iowa State University](https://www.iastate.edu/) and a B.S. Mathematics (Statistics emphasis) from the [University of Wisconsin -- Eau Claire](https://www.uwec.edu/). My [masters creative component](https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/creativecomponents/534/) was on optimal block sizes for block bootstrapping of long-memory time series. I have also taken PhD-level coursework in [measure-theoretic probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory#Measure-theoretic_probability_theory).

In music, my primary interests are transcription, analysis of post-tonal music of the late 19th century (e.g., Ravel, Prokofiev, Stravinsky), and the intersection of mathematics and music.
