*Views and opinions expressed are solely my own.*

I am a Senior Data Scientist at [Design Interactive, Inc.](https://designinteractive.net/) I am also a student in the [Georgia Tech M.S. Computer Science program](https://omscs.gatech.edu/home), focusing primarily on computer vision, extensions of machine learning (deep learning, reinforcement learning, and NLP), distributed computing, and high-performance computation.

My career spans 10 years, including actuarial education, actuarial science, electronic health records, digital marketing, K-12 education analytics, strategic college operations, medical education research at an R1 university, and the R&D arm of a Fortune 500 consumer packaged goods company. My main interests lie in end-to-end data strategy, user experience, and data project management from data collection to deployment.

I taught data science as an adjunct instructor at the community-college level for two years. My first- and second-semester data-science students competed and placed in contests against four-year universities in Fall 2019, Spring 2020, and Spring 2021.

I hold a M.S. Statistics from [Iowa State University](https://www.iastate.edu/) and a B.S. Mathematics from the [University of Wisconsin -- Eau Claire](https://www.uwec.edu/). <!---My [masters creative component](https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/creativecomponents/534/) was on optimal block sizes for block bootstrapping of long-memory time series. I have also taken PhD-level coursework in [measure-theoretic probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory#Measure-theoretic_probability_theory).-->

In music, my primary interests are transcription, analysis of post-tonal music of the late 19th century (e.g., Ravel, Prokofiev, Stravinsky), and the intersection of mathematics and music.
