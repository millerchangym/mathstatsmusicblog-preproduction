*Views and opinions expressed are solely my own.*

I am a Senior ITQ (Innovation, Technology, and Quality) Data Scientist at [General Mills, Inc.](https://www.generalmills.com/). I am also a student in the [Georgia Tech M.S. Computer Science program](https://omscs.gatech.edu/home), focusing primarily on computer vision, extensions of machine learning (deep learning, reinforcement learning, and NLP), and distributed computing.

Prior to my current role, most of my experience was in education in the public sector, including statistics for medical-education research, research and planning at the community-college level, and K-12 educational accountability. I have also held private-sector roles in digital marketing, electronic health records, life insurance, and actuarial education.

I taught data science as an adjunct instructor at the community-college level for two years. My first- and second-semester data-science students competed and placed in contests against four-year universities in Fall 2019, Spring 2020, and Spring 2021.

I hold a M.S. Statistics from [Iowa State University](https://www.iastate.edu/) and a B.S. Mathematics (Statistics emphasis) from the [University of Wisconsin -- Eau Claire](https://www.uwec.edu/). My [masters creative component](https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/creativecomponents/534/) was on optimal block sizes for block bootstrapping of long-memory time series. I have also taken PhD-level coursework in [measure-theoretic probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory#Measure-theoretic_probability_theory).

In music, my primary interests are transcription, analysis of post-tonal music of the late 19th century (e.g., Ravel, Prokofiev, Stravinsky), and the intersection of mathematics and music.
