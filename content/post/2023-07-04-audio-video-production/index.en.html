<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>When I taught at Normandale Community College from Fall 2019 through Spring 2021, I transitioned the course I taught from an in-person to online mode of instruction in Spring 2020. I am not a professional producer or video editor, and had to go through many iterations to find an optimal setup for delivering high-quality sound alongside reading PowerPoint-like files, with video edits and captions. Here, I describe the equipment that was necessary to execute these goals.</p>
</div>
<div id="tldr" class="section level2">
<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p>A minimal setup for the above consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>a decent microphone</li>
<li>an audio interface</li>
<li>a pre-amp</li>
<li>audio and screen capturing software</li>
<li>video editing and captioning software</li>
</ul>
<p>I was not interested in spending a lot of money and went through many iterations of the above equipment until I was satisfied. I am not compensated for any links that I’ve provided here; the links are solely provided for your convenience.</p>
<p>The equipment that worked out best for me were</p>
<ul>
<li>an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Electro-Voice-Microphone-Shockmount-Two-Section-Broadcast/dp/B00U1S4YY4">Electro-Voice RE20 microphone with broadcast arm</a>, currently valued at $500</li>
<li>a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07QSC92NG">Focusrite Scarlett audio interface</a>, currently valued at $229</li>
<li>a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LWH79A">dbx 286s pre-amp</a>, currently valued at $289</li>
<li><a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS Studio</a>, thankfully free</li>
<li><a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html">Adobe Premiere Pro</a>, currently valued at $20.99/month.</li>
</ul>

<div id="why-the-expense" class="section level2">
<h2>Why the expense?</h2>
<p>I tried at least 4-5 different microphones before I pursued the RE20.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> In testing each microphone, I recorded myself using OBS Studio and wanted to make sure that, using my headphones, I could clearly hear myself and my voice was sufficiently resonant. One problem that came up frequently was that no matter how close I was to some of these microphones or how I set up the microphones, I would sound very distant in the recording.</p>
<p>A pre-amp is necessary to filter out ambient noise. However, pre-amps use XLR cables, which cannot be directly connected to laptops. Since I needed to record both my computer screen and myself talking simultaneously, I needed the audio interface to taken in the XLR input to a USB output, which my laptop would take in.</p>
<p>I tried quite a few software products before landing on Premiere Pro, but none of them offered the sort of flexibility I needed when it came to cutting out audio and video, as well as captioning.</p>
<p>If you have very long videos (30 minutes or more) that have to be processed, like I did, I would strongly recommend having a laptop with a decent amount of power. My laptop doesn’t have a great GPU, but it has a GPU nevertheless, which helped speed up Premiere Pro substantially.</p>
